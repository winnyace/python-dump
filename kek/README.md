# This is a virus! Run only at your discretion!!!
**I've made this for the sole purpose of studying, not at all for the purpose of creating damage. Since I've put it on the internet, for the whole world to see, I'm sure someone will find this and use it for that purpose, however. As a result, *it's not my fault for someone else's horrible decisions! It's 100% their fault for deciding that they should infect a machine that's not theirs with this.***

I made this because I got into a [danooct1](https://www.youtube.com/@danooct1) vibe recently and I got inspired to create my own piece of malware to pass the time and to learn new things.

## What does it do?

It effects every Python file found in the directory the script was ran in and it appends itself in them.

On the 7th of January of any year, which is my birthday, it will open my website.
