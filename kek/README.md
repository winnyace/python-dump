# This is a virus! Run only at your discretion!!!

I made this because I got into a [danooct1](https://www.youtube.com/@danooct1) vibe recently and I got inspired to create my own piece of malware to pass the time and to learn new things.

## What does it do?

It effects every Python file found in the home directory of the user and it overwrites them with the malware.

On the 7th of January, which is my birthday, it will delete every single Python script found.

**I've made this for my own learning purposes. I don't accept any use of this shit virus for actual damage! If anybody uses it for that, it's their fault, not mine!**
