# This is a virus! Run only at your discretion!!!

I made this because I got into a [danooct1](https://www.youtube.com/@danooct1) vibe recently and I got inspired to create my own piece of malware to pass the time and to learn new things.

## What does it do?

It effects every Python file in the directory the script was run in and will overwrite them with a copy of the malware.

On the 10th of every month, it will open [my website](https://winnyace.github.io).

**I've made this for my own learning purposes. I don't accept any use of this shit virus for actual damage! If anybody uses it for that, it's their fault, not mine!**
